Train time is a browser application that allows the user to put in the details for the upcomning train ride and the app will track how long it is until the train ride.

---Tech used: AJAX, moment.js, firebase, jS, bootstrap

-- I had a couple issues with making firebase display the right data back, but upon debugging found it was just a matter of syntax.
